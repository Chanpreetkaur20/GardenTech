Humans love indulging with the flora, planting small gardens in their homes to huge fields of crops. But the one problem faced is to be able to maintain them, which majorly includes timely and adequate watering of the plants. This is one of the major reason why many plants die and crops fail. Hence we at GardenTech, have built an automated Plant Watering System, that facilitates proper watering and irrigation of plants at the minimal of costs along with preventing water wastage

# Solution
To overcome this problem we the GardenTech Created an Automated plant watering System. In this IoT based model, we have used IoT components like Esp-32, soil sensor, temprature and humidity sensor.

a person who forgets to water their plants, an automated plant watering system offers several distinct advantages. These systems provide consistent and precise watering schedules, ensuring plants receive the right amount of water at the right time. This consistency promotes healthier plants with reduced risk of stress, wilting, and diseases. Automated systems also optimize water usage, making them more environmentally friendly and cost-effective. Moreover, they require minimal effort, freeing up time for other tasks and activities. With customization options and some systems offering remote control, they are versatile and suitable for caring for various plant types and quantities, from small indoor pots to extensive gardens. In summary, automated plant watering systems offer a convenient, efficient, and reliable solution for plant care compared to the potential inconsistencies and limitations of manual watering by a forgetful person.


# Use-case
The need for an automated plant watering system arises from several key reasons:

Consistency and Precision: Automated watering systems can deliver water to plants with a high degree of consistency and precision. This ensures that plants receive the right amount of water at the right time, reducing the risk of overwatering or underwatering, which can harm plant health.

Efficiency: Automated systems can be programmed to water plants at optimal times, taking into account factors like plant type, soil moisture levels, and weather conditions. This efficient use of water resources reduces waste and promotes sustainability.

Labor Savings: Maintaining a large number of plants manually can be labor-intensive and time-consuming. Automated systems reduce the need for constant monitoring and manual watering, freeing up valuable time for other tasks.

Scalability: Automated plant watering systems can easily scale to accommodate a large number of plants or an expanding garden. Whether you have a few potted plants or a vast agricultural operation, automation can be adapted to your needs.

Remote Monitoring: Many automated systems offer remote monitoring and control capabilities, allowing users to check and adjust watering schedules from anywhere with an internet connection. This is particularly useful for travelers or individuals with busy schedules.

Conservation of Resources: By precisely controlling water usage, automated systems help conserve water resources, making them an environmentally responsible choice, especially in regions with water scarcity or drought conditions.

Plant Health: Consistent and appropriately timed watering is crucial for plant health. Automated systems can help prevent underwatering, which can lead to wilting and stress, as well as overwatering, which can cause root rot and other issues.

Optimal Growth: Providing plants with consistent and well-managed watering contributes to their optimal growth and development. This can result in healthier, more vibrant plants that produce better yields in the case of agricultural applications.

Reduced Risk of Neglect: With automation, there is a reduced risk of forgetting to water plants, especially during busy periods or vacations. This helps ensure that plants continue to thrive even when attention is limited.
